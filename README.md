# Machine-Learning

Some slides, homeworks, labs and other materials about the class of machine learning can be viewed in my another <a href="https://github.com/JB-Bai/Machine-Learning">repository</a>.

However, I think both the slides and the homeworks are not worth reading because this course is of pretty poor quality.

As a result, if you want to learn Machine Learing, just try to take courses taught by Andrew Ng or Hung-yi Lee.

By the way, some reference books are uploaded to Releases.
